# consistency: there is an "n" for which the estimator
# will match the parameter.

#convergence to the truth and low variability --> 
# --> increasingly so as n increases

# it is often easiest to show that
# 1: theta hat is unbiased for theta
    # E(theta-hat) = theta
#2: limit as n goes to infinity of variance of theta is 0
# discussed in week 4

#b
