#problem 1: guided example
#1a
#converge to truth and have low variability --> consistent

#we first show that the estimator is
#unbiased for the parameter it is
#predicting --> the expectaiton of the
#estimator should equal the parameter

#we then show that, as n approaches infinity,
#the variance of the estimator approaches
#0.  Since the variance of the estimator is the
#variance of the parameter divided by n, the limit will
#converge to 0 as long as the numerator (variance of the
#parameter) is finite when the limit is applied to it


#1b
#this code is similar to lecture 4a

#set initial values
NMC<-1000
lambda <-3
#placeholder vectors
xbar_storage <- c()
x_storage <-c()

#create the for loop to do the NMC sim

for(i in 1:NMC){
  x_storage[i]<-rpois(1,lambda)
  xbar_storage[i]<-mean(x_storage[1:i])
}

#create the plot
plot(xbar_storage, type="l",
     main="mean of xbars against lambda(red line)",
     xlab="samples",
     ylab="mean of xbars")
abline(h=lambda,col="red")

##problem 2
#show that sample variance is also consistent
#with lambda 
#overlay the two graphs

#similar set up to problem 1
#same MNC
#same lambda
s_storage <- c() #this is still an x storage i just wanted a new one
s2_storage <- c()

#run the for loop to generate data
#instead of working with sample mean we want sample variance

for(i in 1:NMC){
  s_storage[i] <-rpois(1,lambda)
  s2_storage[i] <-var(s_storage[1:i])
}

#now that we have the data we need to plot it against the expected value of lambda

plot(s2_storage, type="l",
     main="var of sample variances against lambda(red line)",
     xlab="samples",
     ylab="mean of s2")
abline(h=lambda,col="red")


#we need to put the two plots in the same graph
plot(xbar_storage, type="l",
     main="mean of xbars and var of sample variances\nagainst lambda(red line)",
     xlab="samples",
     ylab="mean(blue); var(green)",
     col="blue")
abline(h=lambda,col="red")
lines(s2_storage, type="l", col="green")

#they both converge at lambda (red line)
#the blue line, representing the sample means, steadys out near the truth more quickly, indicating that the sample means converge to the truth more quickly


##problem 3
#similar to problems 1 and 2, but we will need to set up a new dist
#for the second consistency, it will be sample variance รท 2

#set initial values and placeholder vectors for the for loops
#we can use the same NMC
k<-5
xbar_storage3<-c()
x_storage3<-c()
s_storage3<-c()
s2_storage3<- c()

#here we need to change the estimator because s2 is biased for k
s_adjusted_storage <- c()


#create a for loop to generate data for the xbars
for(i in 1:NMC){
  x_storage3[i]<-rchisq(1,k)
  xbar_storage3[i]<-mean(x_storage3[1:i])
}

#create the plot for the xbars
plot(xbar_storage3, type="l",
     main="mean of xbars against k(red line)",
     xlab="samples",
     ylab="mean of xbars")
abline(h=k,col="red")

#this plot is sufficient to show that xbar is consistent for k:
#converges to k and varies less around k

#create a for loop to generate data for the adjusted s^2
for(i in 1:NMC){
  s_storage3[i]<-rchisq(1,k)
  s2_storage3[i]<-var(x_storage3[1:i])
  s_adjusted_storage[i]<-s2_storage3[i]/2
}

#create a plot for the adjusted variances
plot(s_adjusted_storage, type="l",
     main="var of adjusted sample variances against k(red line)",
     xlab="samples",
     ylab="var of adjusted variances")
abline(h=k,col="red")

#this one is trending to convergence but it is taking much longer to do so
#this is what we expect from this estimator


##problem 4
#we are showing consistency again
#this time with an exponential distribution
#we will have to adjust the sample mean and show consistency

#set initial values and placeholder vectors for the for loops
#we can use the same NMC
lambda4<-4
x_storage4 <-c()
xbar_storage4<-c()
xbar_storage_adjusted <-c()


#we have to generate the data from the exponential distribution
for(i in 1:NMC){
  x_storage4[i]<-rexp(1,lambda4)
  xbar_storage4[i]<-mean(x_storage4[1:i])
  xbar_storage_adjusted[i]<-(xbar_storage4[i]^(-1))
}

#create a plot for the adjusted xbars
plot(xbar_storage_adjusted, type="l",
     main="mean of adjusted xbars against lambda(red line)",
     xlab="samples",
     ylab="mean of adjusted xbars")
abline(h=lambda4,col="red")

#this graph is not converging at 4: I just had a simple typo that Dalton helped me fix

#the major goal of this lab was to illustrate the concept of consistency: 
#as n increases the estimator will converge to the truth, and it will vary less
#this decreasing variation looks like the graph is smoothing out
